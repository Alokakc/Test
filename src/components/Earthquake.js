                            <h1 className='heading-1'>Earthquake</h1>
                            <p>An earthquake is a natural geological phenomenon characterized by the sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust, resulting in the shaking or trembling of the ground. This release of energy typically occurs due to the movement of tectonic plates beneath the Earth's surface. When stress along fault lines exceeds a certain threshold, it causes the rocks to break or slip, generating seismic waves. These waves propagate outward from the earthquake's epicenter, causing the ground to shake. Earthquakes vary in magnitude, from minor tremors that often go unnoticed to major quakes that can cause significant destruction, loss of life, and tsunamis. Scientists study earthquakes to better understand their causes, predict their occurrence, and mitigate their impact on communities.</p>
                            <h2>Occurrence</h2>
                            <p>Earthquakes occur due to the movement of the Earth's tectonic plates, which make up the Earth's outer shell. These plates are constantly shifting, and when they interact with one another, it can lead to the buildup of stress along fault lines or plate boundaries. When the stress exceeds the strength of the rocks holding it in place, it is suddenly released, causing an earthquake.</p>
                            <br/>
                            <h5>There are several types of plate interactions that can trigger earthquakes:</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Divergent Boundaries:</strong> At divergent boundaries, plates move away from each other, creating tensional forces that can lead to earthquakes.</li>
                                <li><strong>Convergent Boundaries:</strong> At convergent boundaries, plates move toward each other, leading to compressional forces that can result in intense earthquakes.</li>
                                <li><strong>Transform Boundaries:</strong> At transform boundaries, plates slide past each other horizontally, generating shear forces that can also cause earthquakes.</li>
                                <li><strong>Intraplate Earthquakes:</strong> While most earthquakes occur near plate boundaries, some can occur within the interior of a tectonic plate due to stress buildup within the plate itself.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>These seismic events can vary in magnitude, from minor tremors to catastrophic quakes, depending on factors like the amount of stress, the depth of the earthquake's focus, and the geological characteristics of the region. Understanding these processes is crucial for earthquake prediction, preparedness, and mitigation.</p>
                            <h3>Precautions</h3>
                            <p>Surviving an earthquake requires preparedness and quick thinking. Here are some precautions to increase your chances of survival:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Drop, Cover, and Hold On:</strong> When you feel shaking, immediately drop to the ground, take cover under a sturdy piece of furniture, and hold on until the shaking stops. Protect your head and neck.</li>
                                <li><strong>Stay Indoors:</strong> If you're inside, stay there. Avoid doorways as they are not the safest place to take shelter.</li>
                                <li><strong>Stay Away from Windows and Mirrors:</strong> Broken glass can be a significant hazard during an earthquake, so stay away from windows, mirrors, and glass doors.</li>
                                <li><strong>If Outdoors, Move to an Open Area:</strong> If you're outside, move away from buildings, streetlights, and utility wires. Find an open area away from potential falling objects.</li>
                                <li><strong>If Driving, Pull Over:</strong> If you're driving, pull over to a safe location away from buildings, trees, and overpasses. Stay in the vehicle until the shaking stops.</li>
                                <li><strong>Have an Emergency Kit:</strong> Prepare an emergency kit with essential supplies like water, non-perishable food, a flashlight, batteries, first-aid supplies, and important documents.</li>
                                <li><strong>Develop an Emergency Plan:</strong> Establish a family emergency plan, including meeting places and communication methods.</li>
                                <li><strong>Secure Heavy Objects:</strong> Secure heavy furniture and objects to prevent them from falling during the quake.</li>
                                <li><strong>Know How to Shut Off Utilities:</strong> Learn how to turn off gas, water, and electricity in case of leaks or damage.</li>
                                <li><strong>Stay Informed:</strong> Keep a battery-powered or hand-cranked radio for updates on emergency information and follow the instructions of local authorities.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Remember that earthquakes can strike without warning, so being prepared and knowing how to react quickly can make a significant difference in your safety during such an event.</p>
